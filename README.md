    • Write a project report on a IoT system design of your choice. The IoT system should involve more than 2 devices, IoT platform, and smartphone app (optional).
    • Think about what you would like to design!
    • Development of the system or app is optional/added advantage

## Report Format:
    • Individual project
    • Decide the topic.
    • Max 10-page report. Min 6 page
        ◦ You do not have to implement the idea at this stage
